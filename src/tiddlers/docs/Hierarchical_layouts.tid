title: Hierarchical layouts
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You can configurate your view to display your nodes hierarchically based on certain edge types.

<$tiddlymap view="Family Tree" height="300px"></$tiddlymap>

Note that you ''cannot change the vertical positions'' of the nodes anymore. Also it is ''not possible to store positions''.
