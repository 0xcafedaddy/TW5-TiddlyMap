In a graph, all nodes (invisibly) belong to a certain group (see below). The appearance of nodes in a group can be changed using visjs-styles as described [[here|Tweaking the Graph]].

!!! Matches

All nodes that match a view's filter are assigned the group "matches". 

!!! Neighbours

If you activated the neighbourhood option after opening the [[View configuration]], neighbouring nodes will be displayed in the graph as well. These nodes belong to the group "neighbours".
