title: Working with the Live View
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The //live view// shows you the surrounding neighbourhood of the tiddler that is currently focussed. Note that the //live view// will only display the global edges, it will __not__ show those that were added in private mode and thus are considered to be private or local to a view.

Just open the //live tab// in your sidebar and start scrolling down the list of currently opened tiddlers in your story river. If you add connections from the currently focussed tiddler via the [[The Quick-Connect Mechanism]], you can immediately see the results in the //live view//.
