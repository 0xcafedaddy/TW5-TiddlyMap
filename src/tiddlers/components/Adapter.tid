title: Adapter
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This library provides all the functions to interact with the TW as if it was a simple database for nodes and edges. It may be understood as an abstraction layer.

Everything that is related to retrieving or inserting nodes and edges is handled by the adapter.

You can use the adapter to manipulate graphs or query nodes and edges from any tiddlywiki js-code.

For example open firebug and enter the following in the console:

```javascript
// create a new view
var myView = $tw.tiddlymap.adapter.createView("My new View");

// insert a node in this view
var node = { label: "I am a node" };
var options = { view: myView };
$tw.tiddlymap.adapter.insertNode(node, options);
```
