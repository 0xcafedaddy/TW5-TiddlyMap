TiddlyMap is an open source project and as such warmly welcomes contributions from the community to improve the software or anything else related to the project. This includes ideas, code, documentation, graphics etc.

If you want to contribute to TiddlyMap's success, please create a GitHub issue first, so it is possible to discuss the contribution beforehand!

Contributors of code and other artifacts (e.g. images) need to sign a so called *contributor license agreement* (CLA). By signing the agreement, you as the contributor assert that you own the copyright of your contribution and that you agree to license it to the TiddlyMap project and its original creator (me). This agreement is necessary for the legal protection of the TiddlyMap project and its users (licensees) against copyright infringements. It does not change your rights to use your contributions for any other purpose.
