Contributing to TiddlyMap
=========================

TiddlyMap is an open source project and as such warmly welcomes contributions from the community to improve the software. However, to accept contributions, the TiddlyMap project needs contributors to sign a so called *contributor license agreement* (CLA).

The purpose of this legal agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the TiddlyMap project and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time. By signing the agreement, contributors assert that they own the copyright of their contribution and that they agree to license it to the TiddlyMap project and its original creator.

This agreement is for your protection as well as the protection of TiddlyMap and its licensees. It does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

Remarks

**When not owning the copyright in the entire work of authorship**

In this case, please clearly state so, since otherwise we assume that you are the legal copyright holder of the contributed work! Please provide links and additional information that clarify under which license the rest of the code is distributed.
