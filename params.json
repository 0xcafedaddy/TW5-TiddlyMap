By creating relations between your topics you can easily do the following:\r\n\r\n* **Create mindmaps** and quickly manifest your ideas in tiddlers (wiki entries).\r\n* **Create task-dependency graphs** to organize and describe your tasks.\r\n* **Visualize your topic structures** to get an immediate grasp of topics and relations.\r\n\r\nIn general you may **create, visualize and describe any network-structure** you have in mind.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nTiddlyMap combines the strength of two open-source projects:\r\n\r\n### The TiddlyWiki Project\r\n\r\n> TiddlyWiki has bought unprecedented freedom to people to keep their precious information under their own control\r\n> — [tiddlywiki.com]([http://tiddlywiki.com]/#TiddlyWiki)\r\n\r\nThe TiddlyWiki project is a flourishing community project under the lead of its original inventor Jeremy Ruston (@Jermolene). Put in simple words, TiddlyWiki is a highly interactive wiki stored in a single file that can be used for:\r\n\r\n* Personal note taking\r\n* Project documentation and management\r\n* To create whole encyclopedias\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Vis.js Project\r\n\r\nFor graph visualization and manipulation, TiddlyMap draws upon the popular open-source [vis.js](http://visjs.org/) library - *a dynamic, browser based visualization library* actively developed and maintained by a team of enthusiastic developers working at [Almende B.V](|http://almende.com).\r\n\r\n> The library is designed to be easy to use, handle large amounts of dynamic data, and enable manipulation of the data\r\n> — [visjs.org](|http://visjs.org/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Some impressions\r\n\r\n![selection_421](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4307137/5603736/3a6c64be-9394-11e4-80e0-8ccd5ada394e.png)\r\n![selection_420](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4307137/5603734/3a6ae03a-9394-11e4-8c8d-9ea6126fe902.png)\r\n![selection_419](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4307137/5603735/3a6bfa2e-9394-11e4-8a79-44be861711cd.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
