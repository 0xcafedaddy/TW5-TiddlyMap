subtitle: {{$:/core/images/info-button}} Edge will not be visible in view "<<view>>"
buttons: ok_suppress

~TiddlyMap just noticed that you created an edge of type <<type>> that will not be visible in this view.

The reason is that the view's edge filter prevents edges of type "<<type>>" from being displayed. To change this, open the view's menu and change the edge-filter configuration.

For further information, please see: [[Node and edge-type filters|http://tiddlymap.org#Node%20and%20edge-type%20filters]].
