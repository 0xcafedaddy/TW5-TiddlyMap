subtitle: {{$:/core/images/info-button}} The live view is a special view...

What you should not do (unless you really want to):

* Add nodes to the live view -- they will always be displayed, also if the live view's context changes.
* Change the live view filter -- the live view needs to be triggered by the scroll-view-plugin to react to scroll changes.
