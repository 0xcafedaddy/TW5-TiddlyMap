# TiddlyMap

TiddlyMap is a TiddlyWiki plugin that allows you to link your wiki-topics (tiddlers) in order to create *clickable graphs*. By creating relations between your topics you can easily do the following:

* **Create mindmaps** and quickly manifest your ideas in tiddlers (wiki entries).
* **Create task-dependency graphs** to organize and describe your tasks.
* **Visualize your topic structures** to get an immediate grasp of topics and relations.

In general you may create, visualize and describe any network-structure you have in mind.

A demo with several examples and explanations can be found [here](http://bit.ly/tiddlymap).

## How it works

TiddlyMap combines the strength of two open-source projects.

#### The TiddlyWiki Project

> [TiddlyWiki](http://tiddlywiki.com/) has bought unprecedented freedom to people to keep their precious information under their own control.
> – [tiddlywiki.com]([http://tiddlywiki.com]/#TiddlyWiki)

The TiddlyWiki project is a flourishing community project under the lead of its original inventor Jeremy Ruston (@Jermolene). Put in simple words, TiddlyWiki is a highly interactive wiki stored in a single file that can be used for:

* Personal note taking
* Project documentation and management
* To create whole encyclopedias

The building blocks of TiddlyWiki are small pieces of information called "tiddlers":

> "Tiddlers" are fundamental units of information. Tiddlers work best when they are as small as possible so that they can be reused by weaving them together in different ways. The TiddlyWiki project aspires to provide a concise way of expressing and exploring the relationships between these small pieces of information.

Tiddlers)

#### The Vis.js Project

For graph visualization and manipulation, TiddlyMap draws upon the popular open-source [vis.js](http://visjs.org/) library - *a dynamic, browser based visualization library* actively developed and maintained by a team of enthusiastic developers working at [Almende B.V](|http://almende.com).

> The library is designed to be easy to use, handle large amounts of dynamic data, and enable manipulation of the data
