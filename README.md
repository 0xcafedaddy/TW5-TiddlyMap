# TW-Taskgraph

**Warning:** Taskgraph is cool but unstable. Just play with it, don't use it! In case you really want to use it now, make sure to always check back to the [official demo site](http://wkpr.de/hosting/tmp/tw5/taskgraph/) to see whether your version is up-to-date as updates and bugfixes come quick! For any bug you discover, please create an issue at [github.com](|https://github.com/felixhayashi/tw-taskgraph/issues).

TW-Taskgraph is a [TiddlyWiki](http://tiddlywiki.com/) (TW5) plugin that allows you to link your wiki-topics (tiddlers) in order to create *clickable graphs*. By creating relations between your topics you can easily do the following:

* **Create mindmaps** and quickly manifest your ideas in tiddlers (wiki entries).
* **Create task-dependency graphs** to organize and describe your tasks.
* **Visualize your topic structures** to get an immediate grasp of topics and relations.

In general you may **create, visualize and describe any network-structure** you have in mind.

# How it works

TW-Taskgraph combines the strength of two open-source projects:

**⤍ The TiddlyWiki Project**

> TiddlyWiki has bought unprecedented freedom to people to keep their precious information under their own control
> - [tiddlywiki.com]([http://tiddlywiki.com]/#TiddlyWiki)

The TiddlyWiki project is a flourishing community project under the lead of its original inventor Jeremy Ruston (@Jermolene). Put in simple words, TiddlyWiki is a highly interactive wiki stored in a single file that can be used for:

* Personal note taking
* Project documentation and management
* To create whole encyclopedias


**⤍ The Vis.js Project**

For graph visualization and manipulation, tw-taskgraph draws upon the popular open-source [vis.js](http://visjs.org/) library - *a dynamic, browser based visualization library* actively developed and maintained by a team of enthusiastic developers working at [Almende B.V](|http://almende.com).

> The library is designed to be easy to use, handle large amounts of dynamic data, and enable manipulation of the data
>  - [visjs.org](|http://visjs.org/)
